![NovaComm++ Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder](docs/images/dashboard_screenshot_placeholder.png)

## üåê Overview

**NovaComm++ Dashboard** is a cutting-edge, full-stack web application designed to provide unparalleled control and real-time visibility over your LoRa mesh communication networks. Built with a focus on **dynamic interaction, intuitive user experience, and robust backend capabilities**, it transforms complex network management into a seamless, intelligent operation.

From live node tracking and dynamic configuration to AI-driven insights and secure over-the-air (OTA) updates, NovaComm++ empowers you to command your mesh network with precision and confidence.

## ‚ú® Modern UI Design Philosophy

The NovaComm++ Dashboard is crafted with a **sleek, modern, and highly responsive user interface** to ensure an exceptional experience across all devices.

*   **Clean & Intuitive Layout:** A minimalist design with clear navigation and well-organized information panels reduces cognitive load and enhances usability.
*   **Real-time Visualizations:** Dynamic charts, interactive maps, and live data streams provide immediate insights into network health and node behavior, making complex data easily digestible.
*   **Tailwind CSS for Fluidity:** Leveraging Tailwind CSS, the UI is inherently responsive, adapting gracefully from large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent experience everywhere.
*   **Component-Based Architecture (React):** Built with React.js, the dashboard features a modular, component-driven design, allowing for easy scalability, maintainability, and the rapid integration of new features.
*   **Dark/Light Mode Ready:** The design foundation supports effortless switching between dark and light themes, catering to user preferences and reducing eye strain in varying environments.
*   **Action-Oriented Design:** Key controls and actions are prominently placed and clearly labeled, enabling quick and efficient management of nodes and network settings.

## üöÄ Key Features

NovaComm++ is engineered for **dynamic control** across every layer:

*   **Live Network Monitoring:** Real-time updates on node status, location (GPS), and packet flow via WebSockets.
*   **Comprehensive Node Management:** Remotely reboot, configure parameters (TX power, frequency, bandwidth), switch operational modes (e.g., Energy Saver, Emergency), and delete nodes.
*   **Dynamic User & Role Management:** Create, view, and manage users with granular role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Viewer) directly from the dashboard.
*   **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with password reset functionality for robust user security.
*   **Over-the-Air (OTA) Firmware Updates:** Upload new firmware/AI models and deploy them to selected nodes or the entire network, with simulated progress tracking.
*   **Scheduled Jobs:** Create and manage time-triggered tasks for network automation (e.g., mode shifts, broadcasts).
*   **Historical Data Analytics:** Visualize past packet data (SNR, RSSI) with filtering options by node and time range.
*   **Simulated AI Integration:** Placeholder for hot-swappable TinyML models on nodes for adaptive behavior.
*   **MQTT Bridge:** Seamless integration with MQTT for robust data ingestion from LoRa gateways.
*   **PWA Ready:** Designed for Progressive Web App capabilities, enabling installation as a desktop/mobile app and potential offline functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, React-Leaflet, React-Chartjs-2
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy, Uvicorn, python-jose, passlib, paho-mqtt
*   **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets
*   **Database:** SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production-ready)
*   **Node Firmware (Simulated):** C, Makefile
